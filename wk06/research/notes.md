# Interview Notes — Week 6

## Participant A
**Date**: [2025-11-26 17:33]
**Context**: [Working parent, partially sighted, relies heavily on accessible tools]
**Consent**: Written, initials [J.T]
**Duration**: [~10 minutes]

### Q1: Last time you used a task manager
**Response**: "The last time I used a task manager was earlier today! I use it daily to keep track of family schedules, work deadlines, and even grocery lists. With limited vision, having reminders and easily accessible lists in one place is essential—I rely on voice commands and screen reader compatibility a lot."

**Observations**:
- Has limited vision
- Essential for lists to be easily accessible
- Keep track of schedules and work deadlines
- Relies on screen readers and voice commands

### Q2: What frustrates you?
**Response**:"What frustrates me most is when apps advertise themselves as accessible, but they fall short in practice. For instance, tiny fonts that can’t be adjusted, or important buttons that don’t work with screen readers—these can be really frustrating for someone like me who’s partially sighted. Another issue is cluttered designs; if an app isn’t visually clear or overly complicated, it takes me twice as long to navigate through it. I also wish more apps would let me customise features like notification styles or colours, which would really help with managing both my work and home life efficiently."

**Observations**:
- Wishes to customise features on apps
- Against cluttered designs and overcomplicated UI
- Wishes for more compatibility with screen readers

### Q3: Lost track of important task?
**Response**:"Oh, absolutely—I think everyone’s been there, right? For me, it’s usually when I miss setting a reminder or when an app doesn’t sync properly across my devices. Once, I forgot a critical work meeting because the notification never popped up on my phone, and that was pretty stressful. Being partially sighted, I also rely on audible reminders, so if those fail, it’s easy for things to slip through the cracks."

### Follow up: “What did you do to work around it?”
**Response**:"When I realised I’d missed the meeting, I took a few steps to prevent it happening again. I double-checked my app settings to make sure notifications were turned on properly and started using voice commands to set reminders directly with my smart assistant. I also began keeping a backup plan—a physical calendar at home for big deadlines. It’s not perfect, but having multiple systems helps me feel more secure."

**Observations**:
- Reliant on notifications & audible reminders
- Uses physical backups if digital fails
- Needs a robust system to feel secure

### Q4: Work without a mouse?
**Response**: "Yes, I often work without a mouse, especially if I’m using my phone or tablet. On my laptop, I rely on keyboard shortcuts a lot because they’re quicker and easier for me to navigate with limited vision. When I’m on mobile devices, voice commands and touch gestures are my go-to. Honestly, mastering shortcuts and using tools like screen readers has really boosted my productivity."

### Follow up: "Do you feel that work without a mouse is easier for you?"
**Response**: "For me, working without a mouse depends on the task. On one hand, it’s easier because I can stick to using just a keyboard or voice commands, especially since I struggle to see pointer movements. On the other hand, not all apps or websites are fully optimised for keyboard navigation, which can slow me down or create barriers. If designers prioritised keyboard accessibility and voice-input features, I think it could make a big difference."

**Observations**:
- Uses touch gestures if on a mobile device
- Uses shortcuts and screen readers
- Struggles to see pointer movements
- Wishes that designers prioritises keyboard accessibility and voice-input

### Q5: Eyes closed / bright sunlight?
**Response**: "I’ve tried navigating apps and websites with my eyes closed before, mostly to test how well their accessibility features work—it’s a real eye-opener! If the app has good voice navigation or screen reader support, it can work pretty smoothly, but if not, it’s frustrating and impossible to use. As for bright sunlight, it’s really challenging for me because it creates glare and makes screens harder to read. I find myself adjusting screen brightness and relying on features like dark mode or high-contrast text to cope."

**Observations**:
- Bright sunlight makes screens harder to read (glare)
- Sometimes adjusts screen brightness or uses high-contrast text
- Can be frustrating or impossible to use apps with bad navigation

### Q6: One feature to add?
**Response**: "If I could add one feature, it would be a built-in accessibility settings hub in task apps, where I could quickly enable things like larger fonts, high contrast, or personalised voice commands—all in one place. It would save so much time and make the app adaptable to different needs without hunting through settings."

**Observations**:
- Wants built-in accessibility settings hub
- Larger fonts
- High contrast
- Personalised voice commands
- Doesn't want to search through settings for needs

## Summary (Participant A)
**Top pain points**:
1. Some apps/websites are not fully optimised -> Frustration
2. Has to rely on physical backups occasionally -> Wants reliability
3. Needs to search to find settings to match their needs -> Time consuming
4. Struggles to read in small or bright interfaces -> Wants customisation

**Job story ideas**:
- When I'm navigating apps,
I want all my accessibility needs in one place ,
so I can continue with my task swiftly,
because I don't want to waste unnecessary time.

- When I'm navigating an app,
I want to be able to customise the UI,
so I can understand the content,
so I can still complete my tasks

- When I'm using a mobile device,
I want to use use gestures and voice commands,
so I can navigate content,
because I find it hard to read
